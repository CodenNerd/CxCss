### Isolation Classes

#### `.isolation-auto`

Sets the isolation property to `auto`, allowing an element to render as part of the normal flow of the document.

CSS equivalent: `isolation: auto;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="isolation-auto">This element is rendered normally.</div>
```

#### `.isolation-isolate`

Sets the isolation property to `isolate`, isolating an element from the rest of the document's layout and rendering it independently.

CSS equivalent: `isolation: isolate;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="isolation-isolate">This element is rendered independently.</div>
```

The isolation property determines how an element's content is rendered in relation to the rest of the document. Use these classes to control the isolation behavior of elements within your layout.
