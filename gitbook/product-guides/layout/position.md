<div class="absolute">
  <!-- Content positioned absolutely -->
</div>
```

---

#### `.relative`

Sets the position property to `relative`, positioning the element relative to its normal position.

```html
<div class="relative">
  <!-- Content positioned relatively -->
</div>
```

#### `.fixed`

#### `.static`

Sets the position property to `static`, placing the element in its default position according to the normal flow of the document.

Example usage:
```html
<div class="static">
  <!-- Content with static position -->

#### `.sticky`
