Background Repeat Classes

The following classes control the background repeat behavior of elements:

`.bg-repeat`
Sets the background to repeat both horizontally and vertically.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: repeat;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-repeat">
  <!-- Content with background repeated both horizontally and vertically -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background of the element will be repeated both horizontally and vertically.

`.bg-repeat-x`
Sets the background to repeat horizontally only.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: repeat-x;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-repeat-x">
  <!-- Content with background repeated horizontally -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background of the element will be repeated horizontally.

`.bg-repeat-y`
Sets the background to repeat vertically only.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: repeat-y;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-repeat-y">
  <!-- Content with background repeated vertically -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background of the element will be repeated vertically.

`.bg-no-repeat`
Sets the background to not repeat.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: no-repeat;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-no-repeat">
  <!-- Content with background not repeated -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background of the element will not be repeated.

`.bg-space`
Sets the background to repeat and space out the images, adjusting the spacing between repeated images.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: space;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-space">
  <!-- Content with spaced background repetition -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background images of the element will be repeated with spacing between them.

`.bg-round`
Sets the background to repeat and round the images, adjusting the size of the repeated images to fill the container without cropping.

CSS equivalent: `background-repeat: round;`

Example usage:
```html
<div class="bg-round">
  <!-- Content with rounded background repetition -->
</div>
```

In the example above, the background images of the element will be repeated and resized to fit the container without cropping.

These utility classes provide a convenient way to control the background repeat behavior of elements, allowing you to customize how the background images are repeated or not repeated within the element's box.
